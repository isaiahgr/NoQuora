#NoQuora

A quick Chrome extension to remove Quora from search results. It's written with MV2 because MV3 handicaps ad-blockers and this is kind of under that category.

It just modifies google search query strings pre-request to exclude search results from quora.com, and then tries to clean up the page afterwards. There are much better approaches but this is just for fun anyways.
